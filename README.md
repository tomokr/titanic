# Titanic - to be or not to be

![Titanic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5339011/97196060-69042a00-1782-11eb-9acb-8b79019f913a.png)

Titanic is the very famous ship in the world. The ship crushed into the big ice and many people died.
I got the data of the people on the ship and investigate how to survive in such a situation.

## Data at a glance

Now let's see the data.

> RangeIndex: 891 entries, 0 to 890  
> Data columns (total 12 columns):  
> PassengerId    891 non-null int64  
> Survived       891 non-null int64  
> Pclass         891 non-null int64  
> Name           891 non-null object  
> Sex            891 non-null object  
> Age            714 non-null float64  
> SibSp          891 non-null int64  
> Parch          891 non-null int64  
> Ticket         891 non-null object  
> Fare           891 non-null float64  
> Cabin          204 non-null object  
> Embarked       889 non-null object  
> dtypes: float64(2), int64(5), object(5)

There are 12 categories and 891 of people's data.
*Age* and *Cabin* have some missing values. Embarked has a few.

When taking a correlation between these numeric data, *Pclass, Age, and Fare* look like strongly correlated with Survived(target).
